# github_repos

This code creates a Flutter app with a single screen that fetches a list of public repositories from GitHub's API (https://api.github.com/repositories) and displays them in a ListView. Each repository is shown as a ListTile with its name and description.

Please note that this code only demonstrates basic functionality and may require additional error handling, pagination for large data sets, and UI enhancements for a production-ready application. Additionally, you may need to handle API rate limits and authentication if you plan to use GitHub's API extensively in your application.
